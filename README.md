# Focus Timer - Dark Theme

FocusTimer is a site that uses the pomodoro study method and consists of using a stopwatch to divide the work into periods of 25 minutes, separated by short breaks.

## About

FocusTimer generates a timer on the screen where the user can set the desired focus time, being able to pause, stop and activate ambient background sounds to relax while focusing on something. In this new version, the option to select the desired theme and adjust the volume of sounds was implemented.
